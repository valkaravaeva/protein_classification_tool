It occurs, notably, three times in the C-terminal region of the enzyme disaggregatase from the archaeal species Methanosarcina mazei, each time with the motif DNRLRE, for which the domain is named. Archaeal proteins within this family are described particularly well by the currently more narrowly defined Pfam model, PF06848. Note that the catalytic region of disaggregatase, in the N-terminal portion of the protein, is modeled by a different HMM, PF08480.

Upstream regions of proteins with the PxKF domain often mark them as members of largely surface-associated proteins, processed and anchored by the type IX secretion system, exosortases, rhombosortases, etc. The species distribution of PxKF domain-containing proteins is broad - mostly Actinobacteria, but also some Firmicutes, Deinococcus, etc. That broad taxonomic distribution, plus its large size (over 100 amino acids long) compared to most known N-terminal or C-terminal sorting signals that are recognized but then removed, suggests that the domain is retained in the mature protein, and has some function involved in surface-binding.

It is found in a number of other cyanobacterial proteins called PhoA, although those annotations may be incorrect. Proteins with this domain include a number with the PEP-CTERM protein-sorting domain, but also a number with the LPXTG protein-sorting domain, making this a choice-of-anchor domain, that is, a new homology domain of what was previously "dark matter" (that is, lacking any HMM), whose members include proteins targeted for covalent attachment at the cell surface by at least two different protein-sorting systems.

That final motif typically is missed during coding region feature prediction by genome annotation pipelines. This HMM covers proteins from several distinctive families with this feature. The seed alignment illustrates the final selenocysteine or aligned Cys or Ser residues, but the HMM also hits proteins that lack an equivalent motif at the C-terminus. This C-terminal selenocysteine-containing motif has not yet been described in the literature.

It contains four widely separated His residues, the second of which is part of an invariant dipeptide His-Asp in a region matched approximately by the motif HDIG. For proteins scoring above the trusted cutoff, confidence is high both that the domain is present and that the HMM produces an essentially correct alignment. Protein regions scoring between the trusted and noise cutoffs include correctly aligned domains, homologous domains in which one or more of the His residues is conserved but misaligned, and some probable false-positive hits indications of homology.

Both Aquifex aeolicus and Mycobacterium leprae have one member in each of two branches of this subfamily, suggesting the branches may have distinct functions. This family is one of several families within the scope of PFAM model PF03641, several members of which are annotated as lysine decarboxylases.

Its consensus sequence is 35 positions long and typically is found in four or more tandem copies. This family is strongly represented in plant proteins, particularly those sorted to chloroplasts or mitochondria. The pfam hmm PF01535, domain of unknown function DUF17, consists of 6 copies of this repeat. This family has a similar consensus to the TPR domain (tetratricopeptide), pfam PF00515, a 33-residue repeat. It is predicted to form a pair of antiparallel helices similar to that of TPR.

ELP3 binds S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) and was recently shown to be involved in a DNA demethylation process in eukaryotes. Close sequence similarity of this family (with lacks the GNAT family acetyltransferase domain) to the ELP3 N-terminal region and a strong match to the Pfam model PF04055 support identification of this family as radical SAM despite the atypical spacing between first and second Cys residues in the 4Fe4S-binding motif. This family includes YhcC from E. coli K-12, an uncharacterized radical SAM protein.

Lingering legacy annotations of members of this family probably should be removed. Evidence against the role includes a signal peptide. This family as been renamed "extracellular protein" to facilitate correction. Members of this family occur in Deinococcus radiodurans (bacterial) and Methanococcus jannaschii (archaeal). A number of homologous but more distantly related proteins are annotated as alpha-1,4 polygalactosaminidases. The function remains unknown.

Characteristic motifs in the repeat are FXXN and GGAI. Except for a few apparently truncated examples, Chlamydial proteins have this repeat region if and only if they also have the autotransporter beta-domain (PF03797) at the C-terminus, with Phe as the C-terminal residue. This repeat is observed, but is very rare, outside the Chlamydias.

It is based on interated search results, starting with a curated collection of intein N-terminal splicing regions from InBase, the New England Biolabs Intein Database, as presented on its web site. Inteins are regions encoded within proteins from which they remove themselves after translation in a self-splicing reaction, leaving the remainder of the coding region to form a complete, functional protein as if the intein were never there. Proteins with inteins include RecA, GyrA, ribonucleotide reductase, and others. Most inteins have a central region with putative endonuclease activity.

The model overlaps significantly in coverage with DUF11 (PF01345). Examples of the domain occur within longer repeats in three of the five longest proteins of Bacillus anthracis, in a 131-residue repeat in a cell wall-anchored protein of Enterococcus faecalis, and a 120-residue repeat in Methanobacterium thermoautotrophicum. A similar region is found in some Chlamydial outer membrane proteins.

Trusted cutoff is set so that essentially only archaeal members hit the model. The notable exceptions to archaeal membership are the Gram positive Clostridium perfringens which scores much better than some other archaea and the Cyanobacterium Nostoc sp. which scores just above the trusted cutoff. Noise cutoff is set to exclude the characterized eukaryotic glycogen debranching enzyme in S. cerevisiae. These cutoffs leave the prokaryotes Porphyromonas gingivalis and Deinococcus radiodurans below trusted but above noise. Multiple alignments including these last two species exhibit sequence divergence which may suggest a subtly different function for these prokaryotic proteins.

It includes a CGAXXG motif. Most members are found within one or two loci of transporter or oxidoreductase genes. A member from Geobacter sulfurreducens, located in a molybdenum transporter operon, has a TAT (twin-arginine translocation) signal sequence for Sec-independent transport across the plasma membrane, a hallmark of bound prosthetic groups such as FeS clusters.

The large protein size and repeat copy numbers, species distribution, and suggested activities of several member proteins suggests a role for this domain in adhesion. This HMM for a repeated domain overlaps substantially (shifted by half its length) with newer Pfam model PF17803 (bacterial cadherin-like domain).

There is an N-terminal domain which has even more distant homology to glutaredoxins. The name "glutaredoxin" may be inappropriate in the sense of working in tandem with glutathione and glutathione reductase which may not be present in the archaea. The overall domain structure appears to be related to bacterial alkylhydroperoxide reductases, but the homology may be distant enough that the function of this family is wholly different.

In all cases, the genomic region resembles a phage tail region, based on tentative identifications of neighboring genes. A region of this domain resembles a region of TIGR01634, another phage tail protein model.

The C-terminal region is identified by the broader model PF04865 as related to baseplate protein J from phage P2, but that relationship is not observed directly.

Archaea Methanosarcina mazei and Methanosarcina acetivorans each have over 10 genes that encode tandem copies of this repeat, which is also found in other species, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis. PSIPRED predicts with high confidence that each 40-residue repeats contains four beta strands. This model overlaps somewhat with the NHL repeat (Pfam PF01436) and also shows sequence similarity to the WD domain, G-beta repeat (Pfam PF00400).

It is found fused to GTP cyclohydrolase II, the RibA of riboflavin biosynthesis (TIGR00505), as in Vibrio vulnificus. It is found fused to riboflavin biosynthesis protein RibD (TIGR00326) in rice and Arabidopsis. It occurs as a standalone protein in a number of bacterial species in varied contexts, including single gene operons and bacteriophage genomes. The member from E. coli currently is named YbiA. The function(s) of members of this family is unknown.

Many of the latter group are multidomain proteins with signal-transducing domains such as the GGDEF diguanylate cyclase domain (TIGR00254, PF00990) and methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein signaling domain (PF00015). Most hemerythrins are oxygen-carriers with a bound non-heme iron, but at least one example is a cadmium-binding protein, apparently with a role in sequestering toxic metals rather than in binding oxygen. Patterns of conserved residues suggest that all prokaryotic instances of this domain bind iron or another heavy metal, but the exact function is unknown. Not surprisingly, the prokaryote with the most instances of this domain is Magnetococcus sp. MC-1, a magnetotactic bacterium.

These include 78-residue repeats from 2 to 15 in number, in some proteins of Bacteroides forsythus ATCC 43037, and 70-residue repeats in families of internalins of Listeria species. Single copies are found in proteins of Fibrobacter succinogenes, Geobacter sulfurreducens, and a few bacteria.

We find at least 15 member proteins per proteome in PVC superphylum members such as Rhodopirellula baltica SH 1 (phylum Planctomycetota), Gemmata obscuriglobus (phylum Planctomycetota), Verrucomicrobium spinosum DSM 4136 (phylum Verrucomicrobiota), and Chthoniobacter flavus (phylum Verrucomicrobiota), all of which have a compartmentalized cell structure with internal membranes that most bacteria lack. These proteins typically contain, in addition to this domain, several hundred residues of highly variable sequence, and then a well-conserved C-terminal domain (TIGR02603) that features a putative cytochrome c-type heme binding motif CXXCH. The membrane-bound L-sorbosone dehydrogenase from Acetobacter liquefaciens (Gluconacetobacter liquefaciens) (SP|Q44091) is homologous to this domain but lacks additional sequence regions shared by members of this family and belongs to a different clade of the larger family of homologs. It and its closely related homologs are excluded from the this model by scoring between the trusted (45) and noise (18) cutoffs.

The periodicity of the repeat ranges from about 57 to 61 amino acids, and a core region of about 54 is represented by this model and seed alignment.

The alignment shows no motif of conserved Cys residues as are found in zinc-binding members of the superfamily, and members are likely to be quinone oxidoreductases instead. A member of this family in Homo sapiens, PIG3, is induced by p53 but is otherwise uncharacterized.

Member proteins always have a least two tandem copies and as many as seven. The spacing between repeats as defined here usually is four residues exactly. This repeat is named for a tripeptide motif HAF found in most members. Some members proteins are found in species with no outer membrane (archaea and Gram-positive bacteria) while others have C-terminal autotransporter domains that suggest that the repeat region is transported across the outer membrane. This domain seems likely to be an extracellular protein repeat.

This heptad periodicity, corresponding to two turns of an alpha helix, suggests alpha-helical structure; in many proteins this 28-region model hits many times in tandem. Arrangement of these sequences on a helical wheel would show a strict alternation of Leu and Gly residues on one side of the helix, that is, an extremely bulky side chain alternating with the virtual absence of one. This suggests an extended zippering of one alpha helix to another, analogous to the shorter leucine zippers found in many dimerizing transcription factors. Proteins in which these heptad repeats occur often have higher order repeats of a unit comprised of several heptads.

A separate model, TIGR03062, represents the conserved C-terminal domain. The domains are separated by regions highly variable in both length and sequence, often containing extended heptad repeats as described in model TIGR03057.

Its most striking feature, however, is a near invariant pentapeptide motif DGQHR. Several different subfamilies occur specifically as a part of DNA phosphorothioation systems, previously called DND (DNA instability during electrophoresis), while others (e.g. CPS_2936) occur in other contexts suggestive of lateral gene transfer (sporadic distribution of helicase-containing cassettes). The region described by this model is about 280 amino acids in length; additional sequences show local sequence similarity.

The domain described here, now called MYXO-CTERM, is small (about 30 amino acids), hydrophobic, only moderately conserved, and similar to numerous other transmembrane helix-containing sequence regions from convergent evolution. The trusted cutoff for the HMM therefore must be set fairly high. This domain is found, once per protein but in many proteins per genome in several bacteria of the order Myxococcales. It begins with a signature Gly-Cys motif. Its other features, including a hydrophobic transmembrane helix, Arg-rich cluster, and location at the protein C-terminus, resemble the PEP-CTERM proposed protein targeting domain. MYXO-CTERM domains occur in species with the processing endopeptidase myxosortase. It is likely that lipid is attached to the Cys side chain prior to a cleavage of the sorting domain distal to the GC site.

We name this domain XapX, as it comprises the full length of the protein encoded between the genes for the well-studied XapB and XapR proteins.

A homology domain consisting of a longer tandem array of these repeats is described in the SMART database as CASH (SM00722), and is found in many carbohydrate-binding proteins and sugar hydrolases. A single repeat is represented by SM00710. This TIGRFAMs model represents a flavor of the parallel beta-helix-forming repeat based on prokaryotic sequences only in its seed alignment, although it also finds many eukaryotic sequences.

Homologous pairs, possibly with identical function, occur in a wide range of species, including Bacillus subtilis.

It is restricted to the Myxococcales, a division of the Deltaproteobacteria, with over 60 members occurring in Plesiocystis pacifica SIR-1. An example protein is TraA, involved in outer membrane exchange (lipids and proteins) through which one strain of Myxococcus can repair a mobility defect in another. Users of this model should be aware that the short length, great diversity, and lineage-specific differences in the protein regions recognized by this model guarantee that this model has some false-positive hits (e.g. anything in the Firmicutes) and many false-negatives. Researchers interested in getting a full census of MYXO-CTERM in any member of the Myxococcales are advised to use this model to find lineage-specific sequences and the improve the model iteratively.

Members are present in about twenty percent of prokaryotic genomes, always paired with a member of the conserved hypothetical protein TIGR03915. Roughly forty percent of the members of that family exist as fusions with a uracil-DNA glycosylase-like region, TIGR03914. In DNA, uracil results from deamidation of cytosine, forming U/G mismatches that lead to mutation, and so uracil-DNA glycosylase is a DNA repair enzyme. This indirect connection, and the recurring role or radical SAM protein in modification chemistries, suggest that this protein may act in DNA modification, repair, or both.

A radical SAM protein binds a 4Fe-4S cluster, and the SPASM domain binds two additional 4Fe-4S clusters. Radical SAM enzymes with an additional SPASM domain tend to be involved in protein modification. The acronym SPASM derives from the protein-modifying radical SAM enzymes of the Subtilosin, PQQ, Anaerobic Sulfatase, and Mycofactocin systems. Additional radical SAM/SPASM domain proteins participate in the maturation of quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase, the natural product Pep1357, SCIFF, sporulation killing factor, thurincin H, thuricin CD, etc. The motif CxxCxxxxxCxxxC is nearly invariant for members of this family, although PqqE has a variant form. An incomplete SPASM domain that binds one 4Fe-4S cluster, instead of two, is called a TWITCH domain. This domain contains regions binding additional 4Fe4S clusters found in various radical SAM proteins C-terminal to the domain described by model PF04055. Radical SAM enzymes with this domain tend to be involved in protein modification, including anaerobic sulfatase maturation proteins, a quinohemoprotein amine dehydrogenase biogenesis protein, the Pep1357-cyclizing radical SAM enzyme, and various bacteriocin biosynthesis proteins. The motif CxxCxxxxxCxxxC is nearly invariant for members of this family, although PqqE has a variant form. We name this domain SPASM for Subtilosin, PQQ, Anaerobic Sulfatase, and Mycofactocin.

Members of this family include camelysin (a casein-cleaving metalloprotease) and TasA (CotN), a metalloprotease that is secreted, along with extracellular polysaccharide (EPS), to be the major protein constituent of the Bacillus subtilis biofilm matrix. Sequencing from several known TasA/CotN proteins shows the cleavage location to be near the center of the alignment and typical of type I signal peptidases, with small residues at -3 and -1. This domain, therefore, appears to be a special subclass of signal peptide.

Most often, the putative surface protein is longer and contains repetitive sequence regions. This is one of very few domains for which both anchoring domains occur, and designated choice-of-anchor A domain. The best characterized member is Bacillus anthracis protein BA0871, a collagen-binding protein with five CNA-family protein B-type repeats toward the C-terminus and an LPXTG cell wall attachment motif.

All seed alignment members, and all family members that are not fused to a radical SAM domain, have a motif HEXXH that suggests metalloprotease activity. A role in peptide or protein maturation is suggested. Note that this HMM has been shortened to a new length of 177 residues, from its original definition as a domain of length 399.

Methanosarcina barkeri, for example, has twenty such proteins, often with either seven or fourteen repeats. These repeats resemble the beta propeller repeats of the TolB periplasmic protein of Gram-negative bacteria, part of a complex associated with various functions including biopolymer transport (see TIGR02800).

Some members, however, are extended by one or two copies of domain PF07411 in the C-terminal region. No residue in this domain is invariant. A striking feature of this domain is a C-terminal region that alternates strongly charged with strongly hydrophobic residues and usually ends with a Trp residue, e.g. LEIEIEW or FEIKVRW, suggesting an amphipathic beta strand structure. We suggest the name amphi-Trp for this domain. Some members of this function occur regularly in genomic contexts that include putative kinases of unknown specificity related to (but distinct from) HPr kinase, a Ser-specific protein kinase. The function is unknown.

Members from the Desulfovibrionales appear in the position of ccmD of system I c-type cytochrome biogenesis operons (see PF04995). This family and PF04995 appear very similar in sequence properties, but the very low level of actual sequence identify makes it unclear that the similarity reflects homology per se.

Nearly every member has the PEP-CTERM sequence at its C-terminus (or a related variant), a single for recognition and processing by exosortases, and probably for covalent attachment to components of the outer membrane after cleavage and transpeptidation.

In the archaea, this segment tends to occur only at the C-terminus of proteins, with an taxonomic restriction to theAsgard archaea. But sequence presenting strong matches to this model also include regions found within some protein families of Gram-positive bacteria, especially the flagellar M-ring protein FliF. When this sequence region is detected in Archaea, at the C-terminus, it likely signifies a surface-anchored protein, as related proteins that homolgous through the whole length except for this region may have instead a signal for recognition and processing by an archaeosortase. And an example of protein family with at least these two different C-terminal regions is NF041737, the choice-of-anchor S family protein CoaS.

This suggests both recent paralogy and diversity of function. DegV itself is encoded immediately downstream of DegU, a transcriptional regulator of degradation, but is itself uncharacterized. Crystallography suggested a lipid-binding site, while comparison of the crystal structure to dihydroxyacetone kinase and to a mannose transporter EIIA domain suggests a conserved domain, EDD, with phosphotransferase activity.

TonB is an energy-transducer for TonB-dependent receptors of Gram-negative bacteria. Most members are designated as TonB or TonB-related proteins, but a few represent the paralogous TolA protein. Several bacteria have up to four TonB paralogs. In nearly every case, a proline-rich repetive region is found N-terminal to this domain; these low-complexity regions are highly divergent and cannot readily be aligned. The region is suggested to help span the periplasm.

Many members of this family have an apparent lipoprotein signal sequence. Conserved cysteine residues, suggestive of disulfide bond formation, are also consistent with an extracytoplasmic location for this domain. This domain can also be found in small numbers of proteins in Chlorobium tepidum and Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. The domain is hereby renamed FISUMP, for Fibrobacter SUccinogenes Major Paralogous domain, as putting the species designation into the protein name field can create problems in the handling of annotated sequence data.

That enzyme adenylates coenzyme F420 to F390, a reversible process, during oxygen stress. However, the vast majority of the members of this family come from species that lack F420, and so this protein probably cannot make F390 from F420. Other informative homologies include domains of the non-ribosomal peptide synthetases involved in activation by adenylation. The family defined by this model is likely to be of an adenylate-forming enzyme related to but distinct from coenzyme F390 synthetase.

Some of the first members of this family were found encoded in the (atypically large) intervening sequence (IVS) of Leptospira 23S RNA, a region often present in the rRNA gene and removed during rRNA processing without re-ligation. However, this location is not conserved, so names linking this protein to 23S rRNA can be misleading, and names suggesting members are ribosomal proteins (e.g. ribosomal protein S23) are simply wrong. A related protein, outside the scope of this family, is Avd (the accessory variability determinant) of diversity-generating retroelement (GDR) systems.

All members have a motif RxxRDxRFxxx[DN]KxxY. The function of this protein family is unknown. In several fungi, this model identifies a conserved region of a longer protein. Therefore, it may be incorrect to speculate that all members share a common function.

The other in the pair always belongs to a subfamily of the larger family PF05016 (although not necessarily scoring above the designated cutoff), which contains plasmid stabilization proteins. It is likely that this protein and its PF05016 member partner comprise some form of addiction module, although these gene pairs usually are found on the bacterial main chromosome.

In nearly every case, this motif is found within nine residues, and usually within five residues, of the extreme C-terminus of the protein. Proteins with this motif typically have Sec translocation signal sequences at the N-terminus. The PEP-CTERM region typically appears many times per genome (sometimes on over 100 proteins), or not at all, and co-occurs always with an exosortase, analogous (but unrelated) to sortase, the transpeptidase that processes LPXTG sorting signals in Gram-positive bacteria. PEP-CTERM proteins frequently are poorly conserved, low complexity, Ser/Thr-rich proteins that show little resemblance to typical enzymes. Those PEP-CTERM proteins likely undergo extensive glycosylation and then constitute much of the proteinaceous matter that is often found in the extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) of environmental bacterial biofilms. PEP-CTERM proteins occur, often in large numbers, in the proteomes of bacteria that also encode an exosortase, a predicted intramembrane cysteine proteinase. The presence of a PEP-CTERM domain at a protein's C-terminus predicts cleavage within the sorting domain, followed by covalent anchoring to some some component of the (usually Gram-negative) cell surface. Many PEP-CTERM proteins exhibit an unusual sequence composition that includes large numbers of potential glycosylation sites. Expression of one such protein has been shown restore the ability of a bacterium to form floc, a type of biofilm.

Most members are 800 to 1800 amino acids long, making them among the longest predicted proteins of their respective phage genomes, where they are encoded in tail protein regions. This roughly 80-residue domain described here usually begins between residue 100 and 250. Many members are known or predicted to act as phage tail tape measure proteins, a minor tail component that regulates tail length.

Members are found with the C-terminal putative exosortase interaction domain, PEP-CTERM, in Nitrosospira multiformis, Rhodoferax ferrireducens, Solibacter usitatus Ellin6076, and Acidobacteria bacterium Ellin345. It is found without the PEP-CTERM domain in several other species, including Burkholderia ambifaria, Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, and three copies in the Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus.

It is recognized, and cleaved, by rhombosortase. Shewanella species have the largest number of target proteins per genome, up to thirteen. The domain occurs at the extreme carboxyl-terminus of a diverse set of proteins, most of which are enzymes with conventional signal sequences and with hydrolytic activities: nucleases, proteases, agarases, etc. The agarase AgaA from Vibro sp. strain JT0107 is secreted into the medium, while the same protein heterologously expressed in E. coli is retained in the cell fraction. VesB, from Vibrio cholerae, was shown to be processed by rhombosortase so as to expose the second Gly of the motif, and then to be linked to a glycerophosphoethanolamine, prior to type II secretion. Note that both the processing, and the chemical structure of the domain (motif, hydrophobic predicted transmembrane helix, cluster of basic residues), closely parallels those of the LPXTG/sortase system, the PGF-CTERM/archaseosortase system, and the PEP-CTERM/exosortase(EpsH) system. This protein contains a GlyGly-CTERM protein-sorting domain, as detected by TIGR03501. These domains are found at the C-terminus of secreted proteins in organisms that possess both rhombosortase, which is an intramembrane serine proteinase (see TIGR03902), and a type II secretion system (T2SS). In at least some cases, such as VesB from Vibrio cholerae, cleavage by rhombosortase is followed first by attachment of a glycerophosphoethanolamine-containing moiety, then by transport by the T2SS across the outer membrane and release into the medium in soluble form.

Each repeat is expected to consist of three beta strands that form a single turn as they form a right-handed helix of stacked beta-structure. Member proteins occur regularly in two-gene pairs along with the uncharacterized diheme c-type cytochrome family TIGR03806. Both protein families exhibit either lipoprotein or regular signal peptides, suggesting transit through the plasma membrane.

ZPR1 is an experimentally proven zinc-binding protein that binds the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR); binding is inhibited by EGF stimulation and tyrosine phosphorylation, and activation by EGF is followed by some redistribution of ZPR1 to the nucleus. By analogy, other proteins with the ZPR1 zinc finger domain may be regulatory proteins that sense protein phosphorylation state and/or participate in signal transduction. The search program hmmls is suggested to detect repeats of this domain in eukaryotic proteins. However, search with hmmsw may reveal shorter versions of the domain, as in PID:g1165216.

Several proteins with this domain have their genes only a short distance from archaeosortase C, a proposed integral membrane transpeptidase. This family should exclude members of the PEFG-CTERM domain family (TIGR04296), specific to the Thaumarchaeota.

This stands in contrast to the circadian clock protein KaiC itself, with two copies of the domain. Members are expected to have weak ATPase activity, by homology to the autokinase/autophosphorylase KaiC itself.

The taxonomic distribution is restricted to non-methanogenic archaea, including Picrophilus torridus (locus PTO1314), Sulfolobus sp., Thermoplasma sp., Picrophilus torridus, and Metallosphaera sedula. The gene neighborhood is not conserved, and the function of this family is unknown.

Most domains in this family end with a motif PGF, after which the member sequences change in character to low-complexity sequence (usually Thr-rich) for about 40 residues. The low complexity region usually is followed by a PGF-CTERM domain (TIGR04126), which is the recognition sequence for archaeosortase A (TIGR04125), involved in replacement of the C-terminal region by a membrane-anchoring lipid moiety (see PMID:26712937). The similarity between the PGF motif in this domain and in the PGF-CTERM domain is highly suggestive. Note that investigation of a different case of PGF in the middle of an archaeal protein, HVO_0405, confirmed that cleavage by ArtA at internal sites can indeed occur (see PMID:28069824).

At least two members occur next to family TIGR04083 radical SAM enzymes predicted to act in peptide or protein modification.

This protein family is closely related to PF01906, but is shorter because of several deleted regions. It is restricted to the archaeal genus Methanococcus.

ArtD appears to be a dedicated protein-sorting enzyme with a single target, a PKD domain (PF00801) repeat protein encoded by adjacent gene. This model describes the C-terminal putative protein-sorting region structurally similar to PEP-CTERM (TIGR02602) and found only on these methanogen PKD domain proteins.

This domain resembles the PEP-CTERM, PEF-CTERM, and PGF-CTERM domains of other exosortase/archaeosortase systems. Member proteins co-cluster with a variant member of the exosortase/archaeosortase protein family, and represent a boutique second sorting system in these species.

All member proteins have an N-terminal signal sequence. The majority of known members belong to codirectional tandem arrays in the genus Methanosarcina (nine in M. barkeri str. Fusaro). Nearly all members have an additional 50 residues, (trimmed from the seed alignment for this HMM), consisting of low-complexity sequence rich in E,N,Q,T,S, and P, followed by a variant (PAF) form of the PGF-CTERM putative archaeal surface glycoprotein sorting signal. The coined name, sarcinarray family protein, evokes the predicted archaeal surface layer localization, the taxonomic bias of known members, and the tandem organization of most members.

It occurs, so far, strictly in the family Thermococcaceae (includes Thermococcus and Pyrococcus) within the Euryarchaeota. It occurs in ten proteins per genome on average, and proteins with the domain may lack similarity elsewhere. The presumed sorting/processing protein, for which this domain contains the recognition sequence, is unknown, but it is unlikely to be a member of the exosortase/archaeosortase family. The Cys residue suggests a lipid modification. Upstream, from this domain, most member proteins have an extremely Thr-rich sequence, suggesting archaeal surface protein O-linked glycosylation.

Member proteins have a C-terminal, Cys-containing predicted surface anchor domain, where the Cys may be the site of cleavage and lipid attachment (see domain TIGR04288). Members also contain a region crowded with 10 invariant Cys in 60 residues (see domain TIGR04289), possible ligands to some redox cofactor. Note that a sorting motif is CGP. Previously, the motif was named incorrectly as GCP-CTERM in this model due to a typographical error.

This protein is homologous to phosphoribosylformimino-5-aminoimidazole carboxamide ribotide isomerase (HisA) and, with lower similarity, to the cyclase HisF, both of which are enzymes of histidine biosynthesis. Each species with this protein also encodes HisA. The function of this protein is unknown.

It is the (predicted) recognition sequence for an exosortase homolog, the archaeosortase ArtA (TIGR04125). In some archaea, up to fifty proteins have this domain as their C-terminal region, usually preceded by a Thr-rich region that typically is heavily O-glycosylated. The sorting signal removal depends on ArtA, a cysteine peptidase, in a process shown to be required for a C-terminal prenyl group attachment in the halobacterial major cell surface glycoprotein, an S-layer protein. However, it remains unclear if ArtA acts as a transpeptidase, like the analogous though unrelated sortase enzyme SrtA, or if lipid attachment is mediated by a separate protein.

The aromatic residue tyrosine, comprising about five percent of the amino acid composition, is overrepresented among the most highly conserved columns of the multiple sequence alignment. The three members of this family in Methanosarcina barkeri occur all within a six-gene region.

This subclass is restricted to Cyanobacteria, including the genera Cyanothece, Nostoc, Trichodesmium, Lyngbya, Arthospira, etc. This PEP-CTERM subclass features strongly conserved residues within the transmembrane region, including a Gx4GxG motif. Model TIGR03763 describes a corresponding cyanobacterial form of exosortase found in most species with this domain.

Its putative handling protein, a member of the archaeosortase/exosortase protein family, is exceptional in having a Ser rather than Cys at the putative active site. The highly conserved motif resembles the PEF-CTERM protein sorting domain of family TIGR03024, but membership does not overlap.

Recent work in Staphylococcus aureus has shown that septal secretion (targeting to the crosswall in dividing cells) of the YSIRK-containing staphylococcal protein A depends on SecA, SecDF, and the lipoteichoic acid synthase LtaS, all of which co-purify when the motif is modified to YSIRKxxxGxxL to block processing. The YSIRK form of extended signal peptide directs nascent proteins to the cross-wall site, while signal peptides lacking YSIRK direct proteins instead to the cell pole. A large fraction of YSIRK proteins are surface proteins anchored by sortase-mediated processing of a C-terminal LPXTG motif.

It is also found in rRNA pseudouridine synthase, another enzyme of RNA base modification not otherwise homologous to tgt. It is found, again at the C-terminus, in two putative glutamate 5-kinases.
